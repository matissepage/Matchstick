# Matchstick

This project is based on a very famous game based on matchsticks.
There is a certain number of matchstick lines.
The two players take turns; each player can, on a same line, take one or several matchsticks.
The losing player is the one to take the last matchstick.

If you want to try mine. Compile it with make. Then, run the binary with 2 argument for the size of the map.
